        <h2>HAPPY 20TH BIRTHDAY!</h2>
        <p>My Love, <br>
	MY BABY IS 20 WOOOHOOOOOOO
<br>
I don’t think you understand something very important, so I’m writing this to make it official JYESTHA RAI IDNANI.

I am your biggest fan.

Not for fun. Not quietly.
I mean front row, EKDAM AAGADI, I am JYESTHA PAGLU!.

Every time you laugh, it feels like the world remembered how to be gentle.
Every time you speak, I swear the air leans closer just to listen.
You walk into my life baby IT INSTANTLY GOT BETTER<br>
(YOU JUST DID DHAU)
<br>
I admire you in ways that make me soft and in ways that make me strong.
I admire your mind, the way you think, the way you notice things others miss.
I admire your heart Jyestha R. IDNANI how deep it feels, and it SHOULD ONLY AND ONLY FEEL ME!
And yes, I admire the way you exist, effortlessly, like art that doesn’t know it’s art. YOU DONT KNOW HOW I SEE YOU FROM MY EYES.
<br>
You are just you, I love you so much. Today we went out for Dinner, oh my my You looked Tastier than the Pasta we ate BABY!
<br>
If loving you were a job, I’d be wildly overqualified and still trying harder every day. EVEN IF IT WAS AN INTERNSHIP< I WOULD GIVE IT MY 100%
YOU ARE MY BEST FRIEND❤️

If supporting you were a sport, I WOLD BE THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD cheer until my voice gave out BUBU. (CHUPPA💋)
, I PRAY FOR MY BEAUTIFUL INTELLIGENT CUTE BABY GIRL EVERYDAY!! not asking for anything more than you staying exactly who YOU are.

You inspire me not to be someone else, but to be better Jyestha baby.
Kinder, More honest.
You make the future feel exciting instead of scary, simply because I get to imagine it with you in it, you're my wife for life!.

I AM SORRY FOR THE LAST MONTH, I have been nothing but difficult for you. Thank you for staying. You Are Everything I wished FOR! It has only been 3 weeks since dad passed away and I have pushed you away Constantly. I am really thankful baby girl, Please forgive me.

So this is me, unapologetically devoted, standing here with a heart full of love, saying:
<br>
I choose YOU.<br>
I adore YOU.<br>
I am endlessly proud of YOU.<br>
<br>
<br>
TODAY YOU ARRANGED A PICNIC!! A PICNICC!! I LOVE YOU!!! MY BABY I LOVE YOU!! THANK YOU!! YOU MEAN THE WORLD TO ME. MARRY ME!
I WANT TO MARRY YOU! JESUS HAS BLESSED ME🤤

And no matter how many times I tell you, please know I will always be your FANBOY, your LOVER, your KANCHA BAU!, your safe place, your loudest cheer, and you're my home Jyestha.

<br>

(P.S: I love your farts and your sweet sweet smell baby girl, your SNOT, you are the blessing that i have gotten. You are a GODS GIFT TO ME. MY CUTE LITTLE BABY GIRL. 1 more month till your birthday!)
